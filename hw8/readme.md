- The model considers two players in competition in a colsed Nash-equilibrium loop. The plots show the visualization of how competition intensity parameters (a<sub>12</sub> and a<sub>21</sub> affect the system: if a<sub>12</sub> X a<sub>21</sub> < 1, the system reaches a stable coexistence point. If the product is larger than 1, there  is massive competition and the outcome dpends on the initial conditions. The problems with these plots are: The resolution is too low to see clearly; the x and y axis are not labeled; the ticks are too small. The direction of arrows is difficult to read.
- **effect size**: The numerical qauntity does match the size.
- **data/ink**: The field lines can be reduced.
- **no chart junk**: There is no excessive design.
- **use small-multiples if comparisons are to be made**: The plots are in the same scale.
- **avoid redundancy in communication**: No redundancy found.
**Good plot**:

  Different experiments are marked with different colors. There are many lines in the plot, so labels alongside with the line is preferred over legends in the corner.
- **effect size**: The numerical qauntity does match the size.
- **data/ink**: only necessary infomation is plotted.
- **no chart junk**: There is no excessive design.
- **use small-multiples if comparisons are to be made**: The plot is in log scale, making it easy to compare.
- **avoid redundancy in communication**: No redundancy found.
# Part 2:
- Old plot:

- New plot:

**Caption**: The upper plot shows the pitches from two independant measuring devices mounted on the same trailer: ABX-two and APX-18. ABX-two is a postion measuring device whereas APX-18 is a inertia navigation system. The differences in the measurements are shown in the bottom plot. The variation in the pitch difference is much higher than the noise in either device, indicating either that the trailer may not be very rigid and/or device defects.
- **Change**: The old time stamp was formatted as "HHMMSS.sss". I change the x-axis to be the elapsed time (in seconds) since 4 p.m. so that it's easier to get a sense about the length of the run. The blank part was cut. I added grid so it's more readable.
