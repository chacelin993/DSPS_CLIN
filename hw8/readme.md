- The x and y axis are not labeled. The ticks are too small to see clearly. The direction of arrows is difficult to read.
- **effect size**: The numerical qauntity does match the size.
- **data/ink**: The field lines can be reduced.
- **no chart junk**: There is no excessive design.
- **use small-multiples if comparisons are to be made**: The plots are in the same scale.
- **avoid redundancy in communication**: No redundancy found.

# Part 2:

**Caption**: The upper plot shows the pitches from two independant measuring devices mounted on the same trailer: ABX-two and APX-18. ABX-two is a postion measuring device whereas APX-18 is a inertia navigation system. The differences in the measurements are shown in the bottom plot. The variation in the pitch difference is much higher than the noise in either device, indicating either that the trailer may not be very rigid and/or device defects.
- **Change**: The old time stamp was formatted as "HHMMSS.sss". I change the x-axis to be the elapsed time (in seconds) since 4 p.m. so that it's easier to get a sense about the length of the run. The blank part was cut. I added grid so it's more readable.
